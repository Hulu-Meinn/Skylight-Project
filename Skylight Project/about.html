                  Economic factors affecting the industry<br>
                  One of the economic factors affecting our business is the demand for our service.The growth is in the number of youth who are interested
                  in higher education who take the initiative to apply for admission in tertiary institutions leads to a higher demand of our services as an
                  internet cafe since the nature of our business is associated with the processes involved in applying for tertiary institutions i.e they 
                  require internet services, they need to do copies of their documents to scan them and submit them online. This is where we come in  
                  Skylight internet cafe.</p>
